# NesMulator
An emulator to play NES games.

To run this emulator:
1. Clone this repository and load it into Microsoft Visual Studio Code. When opening it, click "Open a project/solution" option.
2. Have your game ROM downloaded and move it to the games folder. 
3. Go into main and change line 109 with your ROM name. 
4. Click "Local Window Debugger" 
5. Once a black window has popped up, press "space" to begin the emulation. 

Thanks to One Lone Coder (OLC) for helping me understand the implementation of the CPU and PPU. 
My code is inspired/a modification of his while following his tutorial.
